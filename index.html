<p>The legality of Game of Skill</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Games of skill are legal, as they are excluded from the ambit of Indian gambling legislations including, the Public Gambling Act of 1867. The Indian Supreme Court in the cases of State of Andhra Pradesh v. K Satyanarayana (AIR 1968 SC 825) and KR Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu (AIR 1996 SC 1153) have held that a game in which success depends predominantly upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience, and adroitness of the player shall be classified as a game of skill.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The contest described above is prominently a game of skill, once you get that number how you play involves strategy, planning &amp; skill. Do you move the same token over and over again until it reaches the end? Or do you move different tokens at different times to ensure that they stay safe and away from the opponent&rsquo;s tokens? Or do you use your token to kill the opponent&rsquo;s tokens? How to manage your tokens on the safe points (stars) to let it unaffected by the opponent&rsquo;s token</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ludo is a game where a lot of concentration, planning, strategy to understand the opponent&apos;s planning is required to win a game.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A player with good experience &amp; understanding of ludo skills with the best strategy building skills along with the excellent presence of mind can dominate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Shakuni Ludo, therefore, offers a practice mode to let all players play &amp; test their skills before joining any paid mode,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Shakuni Ludo highly recommends that if a player is inexperienced or not good with ludo skills then he/ she should spend a lot of time playing on practice mode to enhance his /her skills as skills are really required to correctly strategize the moves after getting a number on roll of dice</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, a participant should have a high level of skill &amp; need to have a good strategy in order to successfully win at Ludo.</p>
<p><br></p>
